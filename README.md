### Almost Comical: Joey's Developer Journey
I'm a writer and first-wave Web hacker who's kept current with the modern web stack, picked up an interest in machine learning, and found in Developer Advocacy a nice way to turn personal demos into teachable code.

The subjects of my tutorials are the same things I've obsessed over all my life: comic books and music discovery, mainly. I built an international [comics translation editor](https://github.com/januff/textify-typeset-translation) to demonstrate  DataStax's serverless Cassandra API in 2021, for exampleâ€“and in 2022 I built a [Spotify Likes export tool](https://github.com/januff/spotify-liked-songs-export) to demonstrate the API-simplifying chops of StepZen's CLI tool.
